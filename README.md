# Publish it everywhere Mattermost Bot

Publish it everywhere is a mattermost bot to publish your content across multiple social media platform with a single command without leaving mattermost.

Typically, in a company, when a new feature is added to their product, they post it across multiple social media platform(Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook etc.). Mostly the content they post are same, and for that they have to login to every social media, and post it everywhere. This is a tedious task. `Publish-it-everywhere` saves your precious time by posting your content to multiple social media platform with a single command in mattermost.

One more use case would be, If in your company, you want  someone to post content on behalf of your company, but you don't want to share the credentials with that person. In that case, you can just create a private channel in mattermost, add the relavant people and PIE bot there. All the people in that channel will be able to post the content on behalf of your company using PIE bot.
